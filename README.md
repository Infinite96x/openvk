# OpenVK 3.0!!!
A modified version of the OpenVK social network without unnecessary junk code.

We removed all the extra and junk code of the social network and left only what we really need. To speed up the work of the social network, we decided to take the js framework called vanilla.js,
which is currently the best, most progressive, high-quality and fast framework for large projects. So, as the social network itself is very slow, we decided to screw
the vanilla.php library, which we wrote ourselves. it also speeds up the code. 
The basis of this fork, we took the sources of the social network version 2.0.

#Advantages
